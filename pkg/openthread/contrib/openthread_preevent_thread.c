/* OpenThread Preevent Thread 
 * This thread receives event messages directly from interrupt handlers (timer and radio) and
 * delivers them to OpenThread Event Thread. Even though we have OpenThread Event Thread to
 * process events, this additional thread is necessary for safe operation.
 *
 * Note that RIOT's message delivery from an interrupt handler to a thread is failed when
 * the thread's msg_queue is full, while that from a thread to another thread is safe even when
 * the receiving thread's msg_queue is full thanks to backpressure.
 *
 * Thus, sending all types of event messages directly from interrupt handlers to Event Thread
 * can miss important events. Specifically, when the radio receives many packets and
 * Event Thread's msg_queue is full of received packets, timer or tx_complete event can be
 * dropped, resulting in malfunction.
 *
 * Given that this thread manages urgent requests and does a very simple job, it preempts both
 * OpenThread Event Thread and OpenThread Task Thread.
 *
 * The msg_queue size of this thread can be bounded by the number of event types it handles, '2'.
 * 1) OpenThread exposes only one timer to RIOT at a time.
 * 2) OpenThread does not send a packet before receiving tx_complete event for the previous packet.
